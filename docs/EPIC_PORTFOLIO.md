# EPIC Portfolio: SMART->Ingest Demo

This portfolio item demonstrates a lightweight SMART-on-FHIR ingestion and transform pipeline suitable for demonstrating Epic integration skills.

Contents
- `projects/smart-fhir-ingest` — small demo that ingests a FHIR bundle and writes a patients table to SQLite.
- README with run instructions and sample data.

Why it maps to Epic jobs
- Demonstrates FHIR parsing, OAuth patterns, and mapping clinical resources to analytics tables.
- Can be extended to ingest real Epic sandbox data from App Orchard.

Run locally
- See `projects/smart-fhir-ingest/README.md`
